generate a new bar
find all the active buffers and store them in an array
gather buffer data, which includes:
  decide on a name and color based on buffer type: Channel, PM, or system buffer. Named the channel name, nick, or "Main" respectively
  unread messages count
  nick mentions, only if it's a channel Buffer
make the channel tabs arrangeable, with keys at first and eventually with mouse drags.
